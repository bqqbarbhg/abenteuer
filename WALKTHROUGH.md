# Spoiler warning

## This will spoil absolutely everything from the game
## Check out *map.png* for lighter spoilers! (and sweet visuals)

## Still want to spoil? Continue below.

Note: All the stop words (to, the, etc) are optional, but included here.
Actually you can just shorten things to the first letters most of the time, like `g b, t k, g e` for the beginning.

Go to bed and get the dream key. (This is not a necessary step but it lets you go to the prototype room)

```
go to bed
take key
go to earth
```

Go to the hallway and check the exit code from the scribble on the wall.

```
go to hallway
inspect the scribble
go through the emergency exit
```

The next part is tutorialization for the selection feature so you need to do an selection.

```
take an umbrella
1
go outside
```

Go to "scabin" and leave your stuff on the floor and go to the basement.

```
go to scabin
drop key
drop umbrella
go down
```

Start up the AI and answer the questions. The puzzle here was to restart the AI every time
it gets mad so it forgets. But since we're spoiling anyway here's the answers.

```
use projector
talk to head
3
5
2
1
1
1
```

If you want to see the prototypes fetch your key now and go to the locked door.

```
use projector
go up
take key
go down
go through the locked door
```

Now you can play with these prototypes with `use test` and `use dystopian` or just `use` and the selection. No walkthrough is included for the prototypes, just type `exit` when you're done with them.

Now, let's return to the main quest line.

```
go to basement
go up
take umbrella
go out
go to tf
```

At the TF we need to use the password we got from the AI at the door. Try to enter to get to the conversation. If you don't have the option *"We demand to be taken seriously"* you need to go back to the AI part.

```
go to door
4
```

When inside go upstairs and buy some Aalto-Cola and drink it. Then pick up a table from downstairs and defeat the monster!

```
go up
use the vending machine
use cola
go down
pick up a table
go up
use the table
```

There you go! Spaghetti monster is defeated and the game is won.
